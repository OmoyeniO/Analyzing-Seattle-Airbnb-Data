# Analyzing Seattle Airbnb Data

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Goal of this project is to get insights from data about Airbnb business in Seattle and answer some questions.

Some of the questions we want to answer are:
1. When is the busiest time of the year and what is the average price at that time ?
2. Which neighborhoods are the most expensive ?
3. Which listing features influence price? (Build a predictive pricing model)
4. Does cancellatation policies have an effect on booking ?

## Motivation
This project was done as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program to challenge my data science skills by using data to gain insights, find trends and answer questions.


## Summary of Results
Eventually, we were able to derive valuable insights and draw conclusive answers to some questions.

We were sble to determine the busiest time of the year to be January, and we saw a trend of how bookings and prices decrease simultaneously  during the year in Seattle. 
Also, we weren't able to establish a correlation between Price and cancelation policies.
